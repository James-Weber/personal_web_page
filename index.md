### Other stuff

I started doing cognitive science before I did any computational linguistics. And before that, I got Bachelors and Masters degrees in pure maths.

See Google Scholar for a list of publications.

When not working, things I like to do include football, running, yoga, travelling (but not arriving) and relaxing.
