I started doing [cognitive science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cogs.12076) before I did any computational linguistics. And before that, I got Bachelors and Masters degrees in [pure maths](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/mathematics-and-philosophy?wssl=1).

See [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4HLUnhIAAAAJ&hl=en) for a list of publications.

When not working, things I like to do include football, running, yoga, [travelling](http://www.roadjunky.com/2078/backpackers-behind-bars-a-morning-in-quito-prison/) (but [not arriving](https://felix-india2009.blogspot.com/2009/06/paranoia-of-solo-travel.html)) and [relaxing](http://www.roadjunky.com/2087/zen-at-work-vipassana-an-indian-meditation-bootcamp/).
